Large air showers arise due to particles coming from the Universe interacting with the atmosphere. These high-energetic interactions produce several particles and even different particle types. Since many particles decay on their way to the ground, mostly muons are able to reach the earth surface. These muons are detected with air shower detectors and also underground muon experiments. The resulting muon flux is divided into a conventional and a prompt component. The prompt muons come from parent particles with a very short lifetime which leads to the fact, that the spectrum of the prompt component followes the primary spectrum. Particles with lifetimes larger than pico seconds stay long enough to interact with the atmosphere what results in energy losses. Muons from these particles are conventional and follow a harder spectrum.

First ideas to measure the prompt muon flux using the IceCube Neutrino Observatory are presented. New CORSIKA simulations will be performed and re-weighting should be used to create several datasets with different scalings of the prompt component. At the end, an unfolding as well as a fit of the normalization will be performed.
