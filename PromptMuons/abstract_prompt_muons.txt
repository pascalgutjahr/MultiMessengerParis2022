Extensive air showers arise due to particles coming from the Universe interacting with the atmosphere. In these high-energetic interactions,many particles of different types 
are produced.
Since muons have a long range and livetime compared to other particles in the air shower, they are abundant even on the Earth's surface. These muons are detected with air shower detectors and also underground muon experiments.
The resulting muon flux is divided into a conventional and a prompt component. The prompt muons come from parent particles with a very short lifetime, causing the spectrum of the prompt 
component to follow the primary spectrum. Particles with lifetimes larger than picoseconds live long enough to interact with the atmosphere what results in energy losses. Muons 
from these particles are conventional and follow a harder energy spectrum.

First ideas to measure the prompt muon flux using the IceCube Neutrino Observatory are presented. New CORSIKA simulations will be performed in the future and re-weighting should be used to 
create several datasets with different scalings of the prompt component. At the end, an unfolding as well as a fit of the normalization will be performed.
