In the Universe, there are several sources that emit particles which travel very far distances to our earth. When these interact with the atmosphere, large air showers of many different particles arise and lead to current hints of new physics in the muon puzzle. To simulate the propagation of the produced charged leptons and photons, the tool PROPOSAL is developed. It provides a 3D Monte Carlo simulation optimized for high-energy particles and usable in C++ and Python. 

We present the simulation framework PROPOSAL and the wide field of several applications in current astrophysical experiments. To this belong underground muon detectors like the IceCube Neutrino Observatory and muography. Furthermore, the usage of PROPOSAL in the air shower simulation framework CORSIKA 8 is mentioned. Additionally, the latest study to estimate the impact on directional muon reconstructions due to muon deflections using PROPOSAL is shown.
