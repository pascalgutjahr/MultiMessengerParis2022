abstract={A large scientific community depends on the precise modeling of complex processes in particle cascades in various types of matter. These models are used most prevalently in cosmic ray physics, astrophysical-neutrino physics, and gamma ray astronomy. In this white paper, we summarize the necessary steps to ensure the evolution and future availability of optimal simulation tools. The purpose of this document is not to act as a strict blueprint for next-generation software, but to provide guidance for the vital aspects of its design. The topics considered here are driven by physics and scientific applications. Furthermore, the main consequences of implementation decisions on performance are outlined. We highlight the computational performance as an important aspect guiding the design, since future scientific applications will heavily depend on an efficient use of computational resources.},

  journal = {J. Phys. Conf. Ser.},
  abstract = {PROPOSAL is a Monte Carlo simulation library, usable both in C++ and via a python wrapper, used to describe the propagation of highly energetic particles. Originally designed to provide a precise description of muon and tau propagation, recent updates introduced both photon propagation as well as a more precise implementation of electron and positron propagation. Due to its modular code structure, the user can either use the complete propagation routine provided by PROPOSAL to easily simulate all secondaries created during particle propagation or extract individual parts of the propagation routine to use them in specific applications. Examples of applications of PROPOSAL are its usage in the simulation chain of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory as well as its implementation as an electromagnetic shower model in the upcoming eighth version of the extensive air shower simulation framework CORSIKA. This talk provides a general overview of the functionalities and possibilities of PROPOSAL.}
